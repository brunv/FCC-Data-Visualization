    Create a Linear Scale with D3:

    The bar and scatter plot chats both plotted data directly onto the SVG canvas.
    Howerver, if the height of a bar or one of the data points were larger than the
    SVG height or width values, it would go outside the svg area.

    In D3, there are scales to help plot data. 'Scales' are function that tell the
    program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG canvas.

    For example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG canvas and yu want to plot Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be
    in the billion or trillion-dollar range. You provide D3 a type of scale to tell
    it how to place the large GDP values into that 100x500-sized area.

    It's inlikely you would plot raw data as-is. Before plotting it, you set the
    scale for your entire data set, so that the 'x' and 'y' values fit your canvas
    width and height.

    D3 has several scale types. For a linear scale(usually used with quantitative
    data), there is the D3 method 'scaleLinear()':

    const scale = d3.scaleLinear()

    By default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is
    the same as th evalue of the input. A separate challenge covers how to change
    this.
