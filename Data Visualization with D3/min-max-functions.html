    Use the d3.max and d3.min Functions to Find Minimum and Maximum Values in
    a Dataset:

    The D3 methods 'domain()' and 'range()' set that information for your scale
    based on the data. There are a couple methods to make that easier.

    Often when you set the domain, you'll wanto to use the minimum and maximum
    values within the data set. Trying to find these values manually, especially
    in a large data set, may cause error.

    D3 has two methods: 'min()' and 'max()' to return this information. Here's an
    example:

    const exampleData = [24, 234, 73, 90, 6, 52];
    d3.min(exampleData)     // returns 6
    d3.max(exampleData)     // returns 234

    A dataset may have nested arrays, like the [x, y] coordinate pairs that were
    int the scatter example. In that case, you need to tell D3 how to calculate
    the maximum and minimum.

    Fortunately, both the 'min()' and 'max()' methods take a callback function.

    In this example, the callback function's argument 'd' is for the current inner
    array. The callback needs to return the element from the inner array (the x or
    y value) over which you want to compute the maximum or minimum. Here's an
    example for how to find the min and mmax values with an arrays of arrays:

    const locationData = [[1, 7],[6, 3],[8, 3]];
    // returns the smallest number out of the first elements
    const minX = d3.min(locationData, (d) => d[0]);
    // minX compared 1, 6, and 8 and is set to 1;

    Fun fact: D3 can plot 3D arrays.
