    Display Shapes with SVG:

    The last challenge creatd an 'svg' element with a given width and height, which
    was visible because it has a 'background-color' applied to it in the 'style'
    tag. The code made space for the given width and height.

    The next stepis to create a shape to put in the 'svg' area. there are a number
    of supported shapes in SVG, such as rectangles and circles. They are used to
    display data. For example, a rectangle (<rect>) SVG shape could create a bar
    in a chart.

    When you place a shape into the 'svg' area, you can specify where it goes with
    'x' and 'y' coordinates. The origin point of (0,0) is in the upper-left corner.
    Positive values for 'x' push the shape to the right, and positive values for
    'y' push the shap down from the origin point.

    An SVG 'rect' has four attributes. There are the 'x' and 'y' coordinates for
    where it is placed in the 'svg' area. It also has a 'height' and 'width' to
    specify the size.
