    Add Document Elements with D3:

    D3 has several methods that let you add and change elements in your document.   
    The 'select()' method selects one element from the document. It takes an
    argument for the name of the element you want and returns an html node for the
    first element in the document that matches the name. Here's an example:

    const anchor = d3.select("a");

    The above example finds the first anchor tag on the page and saves an HTML node
    for it in the variable 'anchor'. You can use the selection with ohter methods.
    The 'd3' parth of the example is a reference to the D3 object, which is how you
    access D3 methods.

    Two other userful methods are 'append()' and 'text()':

    The 'append()' method takes an argument for the element you want to add to the
    document. It appends an HTML node to a selected item, and return a handle to
    that node.

    The 'text()' method either sets the text of the selected node, or gets the
    current text. To set the value, you pass a string as an argument inside the
    parentheses of the method.

    Here's an example that selects an unordered list, appends a list item, and adds
    text:

    d3.select("ul").append("li").text("Very important item");

    D3 allows you to chain several methods together with periods to perform a
    perform a number o actions in a row.
