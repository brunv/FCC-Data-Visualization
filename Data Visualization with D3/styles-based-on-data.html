<!-- 
    Change Styles Based on Data:

    D3 is about visualization and presentation of data. It's likelly you'll want to
    change the styling of elements based on the data. You can use a callback
    function in the 'style()' method to change the styling for different elements.

    For example, you may want to color a data point blue if has a value less than
    20, and red otherwise. You can use a callback function in the 'style()' method
    and include the conditional logic. The callback function uses de 'd' parameter
    to represent the data point:

    selectino.style("color", (d) => {
        /* the logic goes here */
    });

    The 'style()' method is not limited to setting the color - it can be used with
    other CSS properties as well.
